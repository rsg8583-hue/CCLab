                <p>Ryan Gao / 10/16/25 2:47 PM, SMSL (Super Mega Secret Lab)</p>

                <h3 class="green">Family:</h3>
                <p>The Squirmgle belongs to the Squirmgalidae family, its members are known for wiggling, 
                    gelatinous bodies and skittish, escape-artist behavior.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="right">
                <h3 class="green">Habitat:</h3>
                <p>It lives in aquatic digital micro-environments. It's often observed floating amongst 
                    data particles and floating bits of information which it feeds on.</p>

                <h3 class="green">Appearance:</h3>
                <p>A shifting gelatinous body with 5 to 10 waving limbs. Its form is 
                    never the same from one moment to the next.</p>

                <h3 class="green">Key Characteristics:</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Exhibits a flight response to proximity.</li>
                    <li>Generates 5-10 waving limbs.</li>
                    <li>Enters a hyperkinetic state when startled.</li>
                </ul>

                <span class="yellow">What we know so far about the scutoid?</span>
                The solitary Squirmgle consumes floating data fragments for sustenance. It communicates through gentle 
                vibrations, though frantic, high-speed shaking means it's scared. A Squirmgle's number of limbs can 
                change, and it instinctively avoids other creatures, including curious observers, preferring its own 
                company in the vast digital sea.
                <br>
                <span class="yellow">Guidelines for human interaction with this creature</span>
                The Scutoid is shy. Hovering your cursor too close will cause it stress and trigger its flight instinct. 
                Do not provoke. Clicking on or near the Scutoid is strictly discouraged. 
                This triggers its Hyperkinetic Escape Reflex, which is highly stressful for the creature and can be 
                disorienting for the observer due to the rapid, chaotic environmental shifts.
